# Simulation-supervised
This part of the simulation-supervised package is the top level.

The **config** directory defines the parameters for a simulated or real(bebop) drone,
as well as the default training/evaluation values like minimum allowed distance and maximum distance
travelled before success.

* define training/evaluation settings (settings might be reset by the launch file of the specific environment)
	* data_param: used when creating a new offline dataset
	* online_param: used for flying online
	* debug_param: used for debuggin
* define topics and messages
	* bebop_real: used when flying with a real bebop drone by bebop autonomy (https://github.com/AutonomyLab/bebop_autonomy)
	* sim_drone: used when flying with the simulated quadcopter (https://github.com/kkelchte/hector_quadrotor)
* controller-settings:
	* ps3
	* bigben


The **scripts** directory has the 3 most important scripts for using this package:
* train_model
* evaluat_model
* train_and_evaluate_model

The scripts start python with the following two scripts:
* start_python
* start_python_docker

The other two scripts are extra:
* fly_in_simulation: used to manually fly the drone in simulation interacting with the DNN policy
* create_data_real: used for creating a new almost_collision_dataset
