# Simulation_supervised_control

This package defines a heuristic that can autonomously fly the drone in simulation with the use of groundtruth depth coming from a kinect.
The heuristic is implemented with behavior arbitration. In case of using this code, please site the following work:

The controller can best be launched by a launch file.
The parameters define different settings for different environments.
