# Python scripts
This folder contains python scripts used at different locations:

### Generate training environments

* canyon_generator.py
* forest_generator.py
* sandbox_generator.py

### Vizualize during online performance

* console_display: listens to the controller
* control_mapping: maps the control from the tensorflow /pilot_vel to the drones /cmd_vel when flying in the real world. 
* show_control: displays the predicted / supervised control
* show_depth_predictions: vizualize predicted depth
* show_odom_predictions: vizualize predicted odometry

### Extra topics

* evaluate: checks continuously during flying the closest point in the depth map. If this is smaller than the minimum allowed distance, the run ends in a failure.
* ground_truth_listener: writes the current position away and draws the trajectory on the top down view in the logfolder/runs directory.
